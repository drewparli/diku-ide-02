    <h2>Visualization Overview</h2>

    <!-- <p> Choose one or more stations near where you grew up (or any place you have a particular connection to) and submit a link to a homepage that answers the following main question: How has the weather changed over the past 100 years? If group members don't come from the same place, feel free to analyse only one location or all of them as you see fit. Start with only temperature data, but feel free to include other data sources (such as precipitation or wind) if time permits.</p> -->

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>For this assignment we used the historical temperature data for Copenhagen, Denmark available at <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/" target="_blank">http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/</a>. This page contains a report regarding the two visualizations our group created, as well as our individual responses to </p>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <h2>Conclusions</h2>

    <h2>Individual Responses</h2>

    <p class="question">Which data set (that is realistically possible for you to obtain) and visualization would you include to give a more confident answer to the articles main question? A mockup is welcome.</p>
    <p>(???)</p>

    <p class="question">So far we've only taught static visualizations. Which dynamic elements or interactions could improve your article? A mockup is welcome.</p>
    <p>(Andrew)</p>

    <p class="question">How big data sets are reasonable to load in d3 visualizations? What types of visualizations does a limit like that exclude? Give examples of visualizations that must be based on large data sets and discuss how they deal with this. Could you have reduced the size of the data sets in this assignment?</p>
    <p>(???)</p>
