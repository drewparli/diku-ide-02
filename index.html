    <h2>Visualization Overview</h2>

    <!-- <p> Choose one or more stations near where you grew up (or any place you have a particular connection to) and submit a link to a homepage that answers the following main question: How has the weather changed over the past 100 years? If group members don't come from the same place, feel free to analyse only one location or all of them as you see fit. Start with only temperature data, but feel free to include other data sources (such as precipitation or wind) if time permits.</p> -->

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>For this assignment we used the historical temperature data for Copenhagen, Denmark available at <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/" target="_blank">http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/</a>. This page contains a report regarding the two visualizations our group created, as well as our individual responses to </p>

    <h2>Individual Responses</h2>

    <p class="question">Which data set (that is realistically possible for you to obtain) and visualization would you include to give a more confident answer to the articles main question? A mockup is welcome.</p>
    <p>(???)</p>

    <p class="question">So far we've only taught static visualizations. Which dynamic elements or interactions could improve your article? A mockup is welcome.</p>
    <p>(Andrew)</p>

    <p class="question">How big data sets are reasonable to load in d3
    visualizations? What types of visualizations does a limit like that
    exclude? Give examples of visualizations that must be based on large data
    sets and discuss how they deal with this. Could you have reduced the size
    of the data sets in this assignment?</p>

    <p>Without having tested the limits of d3 as part of the question, there
    are two types of limits: computation efficiency and information overload.
    d3 is likely optimized to perform very well in the context it has to, but
    too many SVG point renderings very likely deteriorate performance because
    DOM handling is expensive and SVG rendering is not hardware accelerated.
    Regarding information overload, one should be careful in rendering data in
    too much detail. When data points become too granular or start overlapping
    the information becomes meaningless as it makes it hard to make out
    patterns.</p>

    <p>Data sets which deal with large data sets might include population data,
    image data, biological or astronomic data and aggregated information (like
    books, corpora, and search query databases) amongst others. The main method
    of visualizating these datasets is realizing the narrative one wants to
    present: what about the data is interesting? Or said otherwise, what
    abstraction should be employed to present the narrative in a clear way?
    Doing this results in a decrease in the data dimensions and density, which
    solves both problems.</p>

    <p>This project did not have an excessive amount of data to start with, so
    there is no reason to consider cutting the cruft away. The visualization
    would still be reasonable if we did a stride in the list of years and it
    would perhaps make the standard deviation comparison graph more succint,
    but there does not feel an inherent need for it.</p>
